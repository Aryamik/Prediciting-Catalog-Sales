A hypothetical company sent out its first print catalog last year and now its planning to send again print catalog to new 250 customers from their mailing list. Determine how much profit can company expect to earn from this. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000. So the task is to predict the estimated profit if catalog is sent to new customers.


The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per catalog.
The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is 50%.
Make sure to multiply your revenue by the gross margin first before you subtract out the $6.50 cost when calculating your profit.
Write a short report with your recommendations outlining your reasons why the company should go with your recommendations to your manager.
