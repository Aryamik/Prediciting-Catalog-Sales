# Predicting Catalog Demand (Udacity) #

The project is to predict how much money a hypothetical company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. Here we need to build a multiple linear regression model and apply the result to the mail-order catalog business problem.

Details:
* The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per catalog.
* The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is 50%.
* Make sure to multiply your revenue by the gross margin first before you subtract out the $6.50 cost when calculating your profit.
* Write a short report with your recommendations outlining your reasons why the company should go with your recommendations to your manager.
